To make things look uniform here's the headers we use for sourcefiles.

It makes it "prettier" as it's applied to any of the sourcefiles 
(source and headers) , giving us a template licensing-style that we stick to
(or at least keeping in the same style licensewise).
But remember we don't change the header of files in the /dep folder.

Header for Core Files (even possible without MaNGOS or/and Trinity):

Please note that if several parties are involved in the creation of a file, you
WILL need to expand the copyright headers accordingly.

Thank you for using these headers when you add new files/modify already existing
files!
