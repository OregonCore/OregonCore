= Oregon Core -- Account registration form =

Copyright (C) Oregon Core (https://oregon-core.net/)

This is the somewhat expanded version account registration 
form that allows users to register game accounts on the web.

Its still very ugly, but if you get bored enough and make it 
look somewhat better, feel free to shoot me back a better version
and I will include it here with credits :)

To run this, you will need:

	* MySQL 5.0.45+
	* A PHP5+ equipped web server

To install this registration form, simply copy everything to
a folder on your web server. You can rename it to anything you
like, but it's recommended to keep it as "index.php" and put it
in a dedicated directory, such as "/home/public_html/register".

In order for the script to work correctly, you must rename 
db.conf.php.dist to db.conf.php and then fill out the correct values.


TODO : 
	Make it look better
	Allow email checking by sending a code in an email to be confirmed.
	Maybe switch to recaptcha.
